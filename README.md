## Open Source Project Checklist

### Description:
Like "To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion", the first point is **Checklist**.
Good checklist allow you to create a successful open source project.
You can use this project [checklist](https://github.com/libresource/open-source-checklist/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md).
Or explore the other solutions below in the [Existing Analogues](#existing-analogues)

### Examples:
- **Open Source Checklist (This project):** https://github.com/libresource/open-source-checklist/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md
- **FindSimilar:** https://github.com/findsimilar/find-similar/blob/main/CHECKLIST.md
- **cfpb/open-source-project-template**: https://github.com/cfpb/open-source-project-template/blob/main/opensource-checklist.md

## Existing Analogues

### Description:
Research existing projects or software that offer similar functionality to your open source project.
Understanding the landscape of existing analogues helps you identify unique features and opportunities for innovation.
Don't forget that in the open source world any person can fork any open project. But if the existing project 
has actual features you can become a part of community instead of create your own project. 

### Examples:
- **Open Source Checklist (This project):** The point is to look on producing open source software from different view.
- **[cfpb/open-source-project-template](https://github.com/cfpb/open-source-project-template/):** Very good checklist
and descriptions
- **[checklist on checkli.com](https://www.checkli.com/checklists/viewro/bedd0e466e6b4f8d22b0abcf6adb1007):**
